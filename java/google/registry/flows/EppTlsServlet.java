/**
 * The {@link EppTlsServlet} class establishes a transport for EPP+TLS over* HTTP. All commands and
 * responses are EPP XML according to RFC 5730. Commands must must requested via POST.
 *
 * <p>There are a number of expected headers to this endpoint:
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>{@value #SSL_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_HASH_FIELD}
 *   <dd>
 *     This field should contain a base64 encoded digest of the client's TLS certificate. It is
 *     validated during an EPP login command against a known good value that is transmitted out of
 *     band.
 *   <dt>{@value #FORWARDED_FOR_FIELD}
 *   <dd>
 *     This field should contain the host and port of the connecting client. It is validated during
 *     an EPP login command against an IP whitelist that is transmitted out of band.
 *   <dt>{@value #REQUESTED_SERVERNAME_VIA_SNI_FIELD}
 *   <dd>
 *     This field should contain the servername that the client requested during the TLS handshake.
 *     It is unused, but expected to be present in the GFE-proxied configuration.
 * </dl>
