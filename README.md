# Domain Registry

Domain Registry is a production service for managing registrations on top-level
domains in a shared namespace. Domain Registry runs on [Google App Engine][gae]
and is written primarily in Java. It achieves in a hundred thousand lines of
code what [Jon Postel][postel] used to do on index cards.

This is the software that [Google Registry][google-registry] uses to operate
TLDs such as .GOOGLE, .HOW, .SOY, and .みんな.

For more in-depth documentation, including install and setup instructions, see
the Markdown documents in the `docs` directory.

### What is a Registry?

When it comes to internet land, ownership flows down the following hierarchy:

1.  [ICANN][icann]
2.  [Registries][registry] (e.g. Google Registry)
3.  [Registrars][registrar] (e.g. Google Domains)
4.  Registrants (e.g. you)

A registry is any organization that operates an entire top-level domain. For
example, Verisign controls all the .COM domains and Affilias controls all the
.ORG domains.

### How Scalable is Domain Registry?

We successfully verified that Domain Registry is able to perform 1,000 EPP
"domain creates" per second, with 99th percentile latency at ~3 seconds, and
95th percentile latency at ~1 second. Please note that 1,000 was the highest QPS
our load tester allowed.

In theory, Domain Registry is infinitely scalable. The only limitation is that
each individual EPP resource can only support one write per second, which in
practice, is more like ten. However reads to a single resource are free and
unlimited.

### How Reliable is Domain Registry?

Domain Registry achieves its scalability without sacrificing the level of
correctness an engineer would expect from an ACID SQL database.

Domain Registry is built on top of [Google Cloud Datastore][datastore]. This is
a global NoSQL database that provides an unlimited number of [Paxos][paxos]
entity groups, each of which being able to scale to an unlimited size while
supporting a single local transaction per second. Datastore also supports
distributed transactions that span up to twenty-five entity groups. Transactions
are limited to four minutes and ten megabytes in size. Furthermore, queries and
indexes that span entity groups are always eventually consistent, which means
they could take seconds, and very rarely, days to update. While most online
services find eventual consistency useful, it is not appropriate for a service
conducting financial exchanges. Therefore Domain Registry has been engineered to
employ performance and complexity tradeoffs that allow strong consistency to be
applied throughout the codebase.

Domain Registry has a commit log system. Commit logs are retained in datastore
for thirty days. They are also streamed to Cloud Storage for backup purposes.
Commit logs are written across one thousand entity group shards, each with a
local timestamp. The commit log system is able to reconstruct a global partial
ordering of transactions, based on these local timestamps. This is necessary in
order to do restores. Each EPP resource entity also stores a map of its past
mutations with 24-hour granularity. This makes it possible to have point-in-time
projection queries with effectively no overhead.

The Registry Data Escrow (RDE) system is also built with reliability in mind. It
executes on top of App Engine task queues, which can be double-executed and
therefore require operations to be idempotent. RDE isn't idempotent. To work
around this, RDE uses datastore transactions to achieve mutual exclusion and
serialization. We call this the "Locking Rolling Cursor Pattern." One benefit of
this pattern, is that if the escrow service should fall into a failure state for
a few days, or weeks, it will automatically catch up on its work once the
problem is resolved. RDE is also able to perform strongly consistent queries
with snapshot isolation across the entire datastore. It does this by sharding
global indexes into entity groups buckets (which can be queried with strong
consistency) and then rewinding the entities to the desired point in time.

The Domain Registry codebase is also well tested. The core packages in the
codebase (model, flows, rde, whois, etc.) have 95% test coverage.

## Capabilities

Domain Registry has the following capabilities, many of which are standard IETF
services.

### Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)

[EPP][epp] is the core service of the registry. It's an XML protocol that's used
by registrars to register domains from the registry on behalf of registrants.
Domain Registry implements this service as an App Engine HTTP servlet listening
on the `/_dr/epp` path. Requests are forwarded to this path by a public-facing
proxy listening on port 700. Poll message support is also included.

To supplement EPP, Domain Registry also provides a public API for performing
domain availability checks. This service listens on the `/check` path.

*   [Draft: EPP Launch Phase Mapping (Proposed)]
    (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tan-epp-launchphase-11)

### Registry Data Escrow (RDE)

RDE and BRDA are implemented as a cron mapreduce that takes a strongly
consistent point-in-time snapshot of the registration database, turns it into a
gigantic XML file, and uploads it to an SFTP server run by a third party escrow
provider. This happens nightly with RDE and weekly with BRDA.

This service exists for ICANN regulatory purposes. ICANN needs to know that,
should a registry business ever implode, that they can quickly migrate their
TLDs to a different company so that they'll continue to operate.

    (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-lozano-icann-registry-interfaces-05)

### Trademark Clearing House (TMCH)

Domain Registry integrates with ICANN and IBM's MarksDB in order to protect
trademark holders, when new TLDs are being launched.

*   [Draft: Mark and Signed Mark Objects Mapping]
    (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-lozano-tmch-smd-02)

### WHOIS

[WHOIS][whois] is a simple text-based protocol that allows anyone to look up
information about a domain registrant. Domain Registry implements this as an
internal HTTP endpoint running on `/_dr/whois`. A separate proxy running on port
43 forwards requests to that path. Domain Registry also implements a public HTTP
endpoint that listens on the `/whois` path.

*   [RFC 3912: WHOIS Protocol Specification]
    (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3912)
*   [RFC 7485: Inventory and Analysis of Registration Objects]
    (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7485)

### Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)

RDAP is the new standard for WHOIS. It provides much richer functionality, such
as the ability to perform wildcard searches. Domain Registry makes this HTTP
service available under the `/rdap/...` path.

*   [RFC 7480: RDAP HTTP Usage](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7480)
*   [RFC 7481: RDAP Security Services](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7481)
*   [RFC 7482: RDAP Query Format](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7482)
*   [RFC 7483: RDAP JSON Responses](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7483)
*   [RFC 7484: RDAP Finding the Authoritative Registration Data]
    (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7484)

### Backups

The registry provides a system for generating and restoring from backups with
strong point-in-time consistency. Datastore backups are written out once daily
to Cloud Storage using the built-in Datastore snapshot export functionality.
Separately, entities called commit logs are continuously exported to track
changes that occur in between the regularly scheduled backups.

A restore involves wiping out all entities in Datastore, importing the most
recent complete daily backup snapshot, then replaying all of the commit logs
since that snapshot. This yields a system state that is guaranteed
transactionally consistent.

### Billing

The registry performs a regular daily export of `BillingEvent` entities from
Cloud Datastore, where they are stored and updated by the running system, to
[BigQuery][bigquery], where they can be analyzed using SQL scripts to generate
monthly invoices per registrar.

### High availablity with horizontal scaling

Because the registry runs on the Google Cloud Platform stack, it benefits from
high availability, automatic fail-over, and horizontal auto-scaling of compute
and database resources. This makes it quite flexible for running TLDs of any
size.

### Automated tests

The registry codebase includes ~400 test classes with ~4,000 total unit and
integration tests. This limits regressions, ensures correct system
functionality, and allows for easy continued future development and refactoring.

### DNS

An interface for DNS operations is provided, along with a sample implementation
that uses the [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/) API. A bulk
export tool is also provided to export a zone file for an entire TLD in BIND
format.

*   [RFC 1034: Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities]
    (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt)
*   [RFC 1035: Domain Names - Implementation and Specification]
    (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt)

### Exports

The registry uses background batch processes to periodically export information
from the running system, including billing information, all EPP entities,
backups, lists of all registered domain names, registrar contact emails,
ICANN-mandated reports, database snapshots, and reserved terms.

### Metrics and reporting

The registry records metrics and regularly exports them to BigQuery so that
analyses can be run on them using full SQL queries. Metrics include which EPP
commands were run and when and by whom, information on failed commands, activity
per registrar, and length of each request.

[BigQuery][bigquery] reporting scripts are provided to generate the required
per-TLD monthly [registry reports]
(https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/registry-reports) for ICANN.

### Registrar console

The registry includes a web-based registrar console that registrars can access
in a browser. It provides the ability for registrars to view their billing
invoices in Google Drive, contact the registry provider, and modify WHOIS,
security (including SSL certificates), and registrar contact settings. Main
registry commands such as creating domains, hosts, and contacts must go through
EPP and are not provided in the console.

### Admin tooling

The registry comes with a fully featured `registry_tool` command-line tool (see
`docs/` for full documentation) that allows developers and support personnel of
the registry to run a full range of commands, including creating new registrars,
running arbitrary EPP commands, inspecting the state of important things in the
system, and creating new TLDs.

### Plug-and-play pricing engines

The registry has the ability to configure per-TLD pricing engines to
programmatically determine the price of domain names on the fly. An
implementation is provided that uses the contents of a static list of prices
(this being by far the most common type of premium pricing used for TLDs).

## Known issues

There are a few things that the registry cannot currently do, and a few things
that are out of scope that it will never do.

*   You will need a DNS system in order to run a fully-fledged registry. If you
    are planning on using anything other than Google Cloud DNS you will need to
    provide an implementation.
*   You will need an invoicing system to convert the internal registry billing
    events into registrar invoices using whatever accounts receivable setup you
    already have. A partial implementation is provided that generates generic
    CSV invoices (see `MakeBillingTablesCommand`), but you will need to
    integrate it with your payments system.
*   You will likely need monitoring to continuously monitor the status of the
    system. Any of a large variety of tools can be used for this, or you can
    write your own.
*   You will need a proxy to forward traffic on EPP and WHOIS ports to the HTTPS
    endpoint on App Engine, as App Engine only allows incoming traffic on
    HTTP/HTTPS ports. Similarly, App Engine does not yet support IPv6, so your
    proxy would have to support that as well if you need IPv6 support. Future
    versions of [App Engine Flexible][flex] should provide these out of the box,
    but they aren't ready yet.
